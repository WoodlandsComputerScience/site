## What is Web Development?

Websites. You probably use them every day. You're on a website right now! What are they though? And how can *you* make websites? 

A website is a collection of web pages that are available to the Internet or an intranet. A web *page* is a document written in HTML, styled in CSS, and made dynamic in JavaScript, that the browser renders, or shows to you. 

Web *development*, meanwhile, is the process of creating websites. The word "development" may lead you to think that web development is just about coding. That isn't the case, similar to how software development is, as we explored in the last meeting. In fact, it's discouraged to go straight into coding a website up, as it will lead you to get confused and write more code than needed.

The process of web development includes
1. Planning
2. Design
3. Content writing
4. Programming
5. Testing and review
6. Deployment and launch
7. Maintenance

In future group B lessons, we'll be taking you on a journey through creating your own personal websites, and we'll describe and help you through the process!

Web development is not just about writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use a variety of languages, tools, and frameworks to develop websites. You can also develop websites of different complexities, ranging from a simple four-page website, to a complex web application with a backend and a database that allows logins. Examples of simple four-page websites can include personal websites and marketing websites. Examples of complex web applications include Google (whose entire application suite consists of around two billion lines of code!), GitHub, and YouTube, amongst others.

Before we dive into how to code websites and even languages or frameworks you can use, let's first talk about different types of websites and components of websites.
